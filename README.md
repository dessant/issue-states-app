Issue States is a GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)
that opens or closes issues when they are moved to a project column.

## Supporting the Project

The continued development of Issue States is made possible

please consider contributing with
[Patreon](https://armin.dev/go/patreon?pr=issue-states&src=repo),
[PayPal](https://armin.dev/go/paypal?pr=issue-states&src=repo) or
[Bitcoin](https://armin.dev/go/bitcoin?pr=issue-states&src=repo).

## Usage

1. **[Install the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/issue-states)**
   for the intended repositories
2. Start adding or moving issues to the project columns defined
   in `openIssueColumns` and `closedIssueColumns`

Issues which were already in the respective columns before the app was installed
will not be processed. To process these issues, move them to a different column,
then move them back.

Care must be taken during the use of the app to not conflict with project
automation presets on GitHub.

**If possible, install the app only for select repositories.
Do not leave the `All repositories` option selected, unless you intend
to use the app for all current and future repositories.**

#### Configuration

Optionally, create `.github/issue-states.yml` in the default branch
of the repository or add it at the same file path to a repository
named `.github` to override any of these default settings:

```yaml
# Configuration for Issue States - https://github.com/dessant/issue-states-app

# Open issues that are moved to these project columns. Set to `[]` to disable
openIssueColumns: []

# Close issues that are moved to these project columns. Set to `[]` to disable
closedIssueColumns:
  - Closed
  - Done

# Repository to extend settings from
# _extends: repo
```

## Deployment

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own
instance of this app.
